# FriendFace

This project happened to be at a time where I had hit a motivational slump in the 100DaysOfSwift project, 
and I found it really difficult to push through this one. Life got busy, I got ill and there was a break between doing
the tutorials and starting the challenge, by which time I had forgotten a lot of it. After spending way to long on 
procrastinating decided to get some help online so that I can move past this.  

Undoubtedly, CoreData will be a vital skill for the future and I will certainly revisit this the first 
time that I need to implement this in a real app (which I would have had to do anyway!). I expect that all the skills
will need to be revised anyway when the real fun starts, and this course is supposed to server merely as an introduction.

Mostly I used Vikto Mayzer's solution which can be found 
[here](https://medium.com/@viktormauzer/solving-friendface-100daysofswiftui-challenge-day-60-61-754309014448) 
([GitHub](https://github.com/viktormauzer/FriendFaceChallenge)). I did try to look at why he took the various approaches 
that he did to try to gain some understanding of how all of these pieces are put together.

Unfortunately during the refactor for the guide we lost being able to tap on a friend and enter the `DetailView` for that
friend, but this would have been brought back if this was a real applicatoin. We also lost tags.
